## OpenAI GPT-2

We trained OpenAI's GPT-2 with marketing phrases scraped from promotion emails, in order to generate useful marketing phrases. The result for the time being is not too useful, as the training data was not sanitized perfectly and the resulting GPT-2 model produces noisy sentences with occasional gibberish. Nonetheless, we did observe that the trained model produces more marketing-inclined phrases than its base model.

## Current Status

The project is on pause.
